You're reading about **Lifespan Events** in FastAPI — an advanced but essential feature for managing application-wide startup and shutdown behavior.

Let me **summarize and clearly explain** it for you:

---

## 🧠 What Are Lifespan Events?

**Lifespan events** allow you to run **custom logic:**

| When?                       | Purpose                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Before the app starts**   | Set up resources (e.g. connect to DB, load models)   |
| **When the app shuts down** | Clean up (e.g. close DB, clear memory, log shutdown) |

This ensures the code **runs once** during the app’s lifecycle (not per request).

---

## ✅ Real-World Use Case

Let’s say:

* You have a **machine learning model** that takes time to load.
* You want to **load it once**, **reuse it for every request**, and **release resources on shutdown**.

## ⚙️ How To Implement Lifespan Logic in FastAPI

### ✨ Modern and Recommended Way: `lifespan=`

Use an **async context manager** and pass it to the FastAPI app.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

# Simulated ML model
def fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model(x: float):
    return x * 42

ml_models = {}

# Lifespan context manager
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    print("🚀 Startup: Loading ML model...")
    ml_models["answer_to_everything"] = fake_answer_to_everything_ml_model
    yield  # App runs between startup and shutdown
    print("🛑 Shutdown: Cleaning up...")
    ml_models.clear()

# Use lifespan in FastAPI
app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

@app.get("/predict")
async def predict(x: float):
    result = ml_models["answer_to_everything"](x)
    return {"result": result}
```

### 🔍 Explanation:

* **Before `yield`:** Code runs on **startup**.
* **After `yield`:** Code runs on **shutdown**.
* FastAPI handles `lifespan` automatically.

---

## 🧓 Deprecated Way: `@app.on_event()`

FastAPI also used to support:

```python
@app.on_event("startup")
async def load_model():
    ...

@app.on_event("shutdown")
def cleanup():
    ...
```

🔴 **Deprecated** if you're using `lifespan=` — you should use **one or the other, not both**.

---

## 🔁 Analogy: Async Context Manager

The `lifespan()` function behaves like:

```python
async with lifespan(app):
    await serve_requests()
```

So:

* **Before `yield`** = setup
* **After `yield`** = teardown

---

## ✅ When to Use Lifespan?

Use it when you need to:

* Connect to or initialize shared resources (DB, Redis, ML models, etc.)
* Clean up on shutdown (close connections, flush logs)
* Avoid global setup that affects tests or tooling

---

## 🧪 Testing Advantage

Using `lifespan` keeps your tests fast:

* Test tools like `TestClient` won't run `lifespan()` unless they’re testing full app behavior
* No need to load heavy ML models or DBs during simple unit tests

## Summary Table

| Method                      | Usage                       | Recommended? |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| `@app.on_event("startup")`  | Old way                     | ❌ Deprecated |
| `@app.on_event("shutdown")` | Old way                     | ❌ Deprecated |
| `lifespan=` parameter       | Modern + cleaner + testable | ✅ Yes        |
