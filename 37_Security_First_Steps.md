## 🔑 What You Just Built

Here’s a quick recap of what the code does:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

app = FastAPI()

# This dependency will look for the token in the Authorization header
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(token: Annotated[str, Depends(oauth2_scheme)]):
    return {"token": token}
```

### 🔍 How it works

1. **`OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")`**  
   - This creates a dependency that tells FastAPI:
     - "Expect a token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header"
     - "When someone wants a token, they should go to `/token`"

2. **`Depends(oauth2_scheme)`**  
   - This automatically extracts the token from the request headers and makes it available to the path operation.
   - You can now use that token to authenticate or extract the user in more advanced setups.

3. **This example just returns the token**, but in a real app, you'd use the token to:
   - Decode it (usually JWT)
   - Look up the user
   - Check roles/permissions

## ⚙️ Next Steps (What’s Missing)

Right now, the `/token` route doesn’t exist yet. That’s the route where users would:
- Send username and password
- Get a token in response (usually a JWT)

You’ll need to:
- Add `/token` POST endpoint
- Use `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` to handle form data
- Verify user credentials
- Generate and return a token

Here’s a teaser of what’s coming:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm

@app.post("/token")
async def login(form_data: Annotated[OAuth2PasswordRequestForm, Depends()]):
    username = form_data.username
    password = form_data.password
    # Verify credentials, generate token...
    return {"access_token": "some-token", "token_type": "bearer"}
```

## 🧠 Summary

| Concept               | What It Does                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `OAuth2PasswordBearer` | Dependency to extract Bearer token            |
| `tokenUrl="token"`     | URL where clients can request a token         |
| `/items/`              | Protected route that expects a Bearer token   |

## 🔐 What You Have Now

You've implemented this:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
from typing import Annotated

app = FastAPI()

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(token: Annotated[str, Depends(oauth2_scheme)]):
    return {"token": token}
```

This does:

- Defines a **security scheme** that expects an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- Integrates into FastAPI's OpenAPI docs (try `/docs` or `/redoc` to see it).
- Automatically returns **401 Unauthorized** if the header is missing or invalid format.
- Provides the `token` string to your route.

🧠 **Key takeaway**: FastAPI is already protecting your endpoint and injecting the Bearer token automatically!

## 🚧 What’s Missing (And What’s Next)

Right now, this token could be anything — it's not being **validated** or **generated**. Your API isn't checking whether it's real, expired, or tied to a user.

So next steps are:

### ✅ 1. Create the `/token` route
This will:
- Accept `username` and `password` as form data
- Verify credentials
- Return an access token (usually JWT)

### 🧾 2. Use `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`
FastAPI has a built-in dependency that parses the form.

### 🔑 3. Generate a JWT token
You'll use `python-jose` or `PyJWT` to create secure tokens.

### 🧍 4. Decode the token and retrieve the user in other routes
Create a `get_current_user` dependency that decodes the token and returns user info.

---

### 🧪 Want a Quick Preview?

Here's what your `/token` route might look like:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from typing import Annotated

app = FastAPI()

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

@app.post("/token")
async def login(form_data: Annotated[OAuth2PasswordRequestForm, Depends()]):
    if form_data.username != "admin" or form_data.password != "secret":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Incorrect credentials")
    
    return {"access_token": "fake-jwt-token", "token_type": "bearer"}
```

🔐 This lets you get a fake token from `/token`, and use it in the `/items/` endpoint.
