Thanks for sharing this detailed explanation of **OpenAPI Callbacks** with FastAPI! It’s a really neat and somewhat advanced feature for documenting how your API calls back an external API after certain events.

---

### Quick Summary & Key Points:

* **What are Callbacks?**
  When your API (server A) calls an external API (server B) to notify about some event — that’s a **callback** from your API to an external API.

* **Why Document Callbacks?**
  The external API is expected to have a certain shape (path, request body, response) so the developer of that external API knows exactly how to implement it to handle your callbacks correctly.

* **How to Document Callbacks in FastAPI?**

  * You create an `APIRouter` that *mimics* the external API path and request/response schemas but **does not implement real logic** (just `pass` in the function).
  * Use the special OpenAPI expression syntax like `"{$callback_url}/invoices/{$request.body.id}"` to show how the callback URL will be constructed dynamically using data from the incoming request to your API.
  * Attach the `.routes` of that callback router to your main API endpoint using the `callbacks` parameter in the path decorator.

* **What does this do in the docs?**
  Your OpenAPI (Swagger UI) docs will include a **Callbacks section**, showing how the external API should be implemented, what requests it should expect, and what responses it should return.

### Minimal example recap (from your code):

```python
from typing import Union
from fastapi import APIRouter, FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel, HttpUrl

app = FastAPI()

class Invoice(BaseModel):
    id: str
    title: Union[str, None] = None
    customer: str
    total: float

class InvoiceEvent(BaseModel):
    description: str
    paid: bool

class InvoiceEventReceived(BaseModel):
    ok: bool

# This router documents the external callback endpoint
invoices_callback_router = APIRouter()

@invoices_callback_router.post(
    "{$callback_url}/invoices/{$request.body.id}",  # OpenAPI expression for callback path
    response_model=InvoiceEventReceived
)
def invoice_notification(body: InvoiceEvent):
    pass  # No real implementation; just for docs

@app.post("/invoices/", callbacks=invoices_callback_router.routes)
def create_invoice(invoice: Invoice, callback_url: Union[HttpUrl, None] = None):
    """
    Creates an invoice, then sends callback notification to external API.
    """
    # Real logic to create invoice and send callback would go here
    return {"msg": "Invoice received"}
```

---

### How it works in practice:

* Client sends a POST to `/invoices/` with an `Invoice` JSON and a `callback_url` query parameter.
* Your API processes the invoice.
* Your API (in real life) would then send a POST request to the external API at a URL like
  `https://external-callback-url/invoices/<invoice_id>`, with the body `InvoiceEvent`.
* Your docs clearly show how the external API should be built, with the correct path and expected body/response.

---

### Why this is useful

* It **improves API discoverability** by showing not just your API, but the external APIs you expect clients to implement.
* It **prevents misunderstanding** about what the callback request will look like.
* It’s fully integrated into **OpenAPI spec**, so tools and code generators understand your callbacks.

* How to implement the actual callback sending logic inside `create_invoice`?
* How to test callbacks or simulate them?
* More examples of using advanced OpenAPI expressions in callback paths?
* Or maybe how to consume such APIs in clients?
