You're now diving into **Advanced Middleware** in FastAPI â€” a powerful way to add cross-cutting logic like logging, compression, security, and more.

Hereâ€™s a clear breakdown of what you need to know and how to apply it effectively:

---

## âœ… What Is Middleware in FastAPI?

Middleware is a layer that wraps around every request and response in your app.

Use it to:

* Modify or inspect requests before they reach your route handlers
* Modify or inspect responses before they're sent back
* Add logging, authentication, rate limiting, gzip compression, etc.

FastAPI (via Starlette) uses **ASGI middleware**, which means any ASGI-compatible middleware works.

---

## ðŸ”§ Adding Middleware the Right Way

Always use `app.add_middleware()` instead of wrapping manually.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from unicorn import UnicornMiddleware  # hypothetical ASGI middleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(UnicornMiddleware, some_config="rainbow")
```

This ensures:

* Error handlers keep working
* Middleware is added in the correct order
* You donâ€™t break FastAPI internals

## ðŸš€ Built-in and Common Middlewares

### 1. **HTTPSRedirectMiddleware**

Redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.httpsredirect import HTTPSRedirectMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(HTTPSRedirectMiddleware)
```

> Useful when deploying behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) and want to enforce HTTPS.

---

### 2. **TrustedHostMiddleware**

Prevents [host header attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header).

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(
    TrustedHostMiddleware,
    allowed_hosts=["example.com", "*.example.com"]
)
```

> Set `allowed_hosts=["*"]` to allow everything (not recommended for production).

---

### 3. **GZipMiddleware**

Compresses large responses using GZip.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.gzip import GZipMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(GZipMiddleware, minimum_size=1000, compresslevel=5)
```

* `minimum_size`: bytes threshold for compression (default: 500)
* `compresslevel`: 1 (faster/larger) to 9 (slower/smaller)

---

## âœ¨ Example: Custom Logging Middleware

To really understand middleware, try writing your own:

```python
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
from starlette.requests import Request
import time

class LoggingMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        start_time = time.time()
        response = await call_next(request)
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        print(f"{request.method} {request.url.path} completed in {duration:.2f}s")
        return response

app.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware)
```

---

## âœ… Summary

| Middleware                  | Purpose                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `HTTPSRedirectMiddleware`   | Enforce HTTPS scheme                    |
| `TrustedHostMiddleware`     | Prevent Host header attacks             |
| `GZipMiddleware`            | GZip compress large responses           |
| `Custom/BaseHTTPMiddleware` | Build your own (logging, auth, metrics) |

---

## ðŸš€ Bonus Tip: Middleware Order Matters

Middlewares are applied **in the order they are added**.

For example:

```python
app.add_middleware(HTTPSRedirectMiddleware)
app.add_middleware(GZipMiddleware)
```

Here, HTTPS redirection happens before GZip compression.
