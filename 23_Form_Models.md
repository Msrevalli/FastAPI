You're now diving into **Form Models** in FastAPI â€” a clean and scalable way to manage form data using Pydantic models. This is especially helpful when working with multiple fields, validations, or when you want to reuse the same structure across endpoints.

Letâ€™s break it all down:

---

## ðŸš€ Using Pydantic Models for Form Data

Normally, FastAPI expects **JSON bodies** with Pydantic models. But now, with `Form()`, you can apply the same concept to **form fields** (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).

> âœ… Supported in FastAPI **0.113.0+**

### ðŸ§ª Example: Login with a Pydantic Model

```python
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import FastAPI, Form
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class FormData(BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str

@app.post("/login/")
async def login(data: Annotated[FormData, Form()]):
    return data
```

- FastAPI uses the form fields to **populate the Pydantic model**.
- The docs (`/docs`) will automatically reflect the form inputs.
- `Form()` here tells FastAPI to parse fields from form data (not JSON).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Validation and Reuse

Since you're using Pydantic, you get **all its power**:
- Validation rules
- Field aliases
- Descriptions
- Examples
- Reuse across routes

```python
class FormData(BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str

    model_config = {
        "extra": "forbid"  # optional - see below
    }
```

---

## â›” Forbid Extra Fields

> âœ… Supported in FastAPI **0.114.0+**

If you want to **reject any unexpected form fields**, add this to your Pydantic model:

```python
model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}
```

### Example:

```python
class FormData(BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str
    model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}
```

If a client submits extra data:

```bash
username=Rick&password=Portal+Gun&extra=Mr.+Poopybutthole
```

Theyâ€™ll get a 422 response:

```json
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "extra_forbidden",
      "loc": ["body", "extra"],
      "msg": "Extra inputs are not permitted",
      "input": "Mr. Poopybutthole"
    }
  ]
}
```

## ðŸ§¾ When to Use Form Models?

| Use Case | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Large form data | Cleaner code with Pydantic |
| Reusable form structure | Centralize logic |
| Strict validation | Use `extra="forbid"` |
| Better OpenAPI docs | Fields auto-listed with validation |

---

## âœ… Summary

- `Form()` + Pydantic models = clean form handling.
- Install `python-multipart` to support form parsing.
- Use `Annotated[Model, Form()]` to bind form data to Pydantic.
- Add `model_config = {"extra": "forbid"}` to reject unknown fields.
